The winter atmosphere came from layered pads and a lot of reverb on everything. I wanted it to feel like you were standing outside in the cold, watching snow fall slowly — calm but a little melancholic.",

I built the produced the song to finish and i send the mockup drums to kula and told him you can put your own spin to the drums and he killed it, like i put a half time section in it before the key change and he went insane on the half time section and his drums conbined with my guitars and the song just came alive, it was a really fun process and i hope to work with him again in the future.",
